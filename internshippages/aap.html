    	<p>
    		Jupiter Research Foundation desired to build an automated microscope payload to deploy on a Liquid Robotics Waveglider platform in a standard Liquid Robotics Drybox.  (Most of Jupiter Research Foundation was responsible for development of the original Waveglider platform, and we own three Wavegliders.)<a href="http://liquidr.com/technology/waveglider/how-it-works.html">What is a Waveglider? described by Liquid Robotics.</a> </p>
    	<p>
After evaluating the hardware of a few commercial bench-top fluid handling microscopes, and deciding none of them were well suited for deployment on an automated platform. We chose to build our own microscope out of Navitar microscope components, building a exoskeleton frame to align all the parts to image through a                 simple rectangular glass flowcell.
    	</p>
        <p>
        At this time, the Jupiter Research Foundation microscope is the only microscope we know of that runs fully autonomously, and with integration into a robust marine robotics platform, it can travel to any body of water and image the plankton that live there, without the expense of sending a boat with many people out to take the same images.

    <span class="aboutheading">My role:</span>
    <p>
    Although I was an intern, due to the small size of the company I had fairly broad responsibilities both for the regular running of the company, and for the microscope project in particular.
Broadly, I was responsible for a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>
                   <span class="aboutheading">CAD:</span>  As the member of Jupiter Research with the most experience in the manufacture of parts, I sat in on most formal CAD design reviews to evaluate manufacturability.  In addition, I regularly worked with the other mechanical engineering intern to help ensure that any potential problems were nipped in the bud before we had to go to a formal review.</li>
                <li>
                 <span class="aboutheading">Third Party Integration:</span>  My primary role was to evaluate 3rd party hardware from a mechanical perspective and ensure that we would be able to integrate their hardware without significant redesign work, and that the hardware would be able to hold up to long term deployment in the harsh environment of the open ocean.  This included both selection of off the shelf hardware and conversing with our 3rd party CNC and rapid prototype vendors.
                </li>
                <li>
                 <span class="aboutheading">Testing:</span>  As with any new project, it was necessary to test many subcomponents of the microscope before they were fit to be built into the overall system.  I spent a significant amount of time devising test beds, checking on the hardware being tested, and growing plankton to look at under the microscope while it was on the bench.
                </li>
    </ul>

        After considering the optics of the desired objective and condenser pair, I did a little more research and found that for our field of view and depth of focus combination, there existed an off-the-shelf borosilicate glass tube that matched our optical parameters.  We brought some in for testing and they worked great!

    </div><div class="textblock">
	<p>
       We liked the optical qualities of the flow cell, but obviously our original version wasn't going to cut it.  We build a standard microscope-slide mountable version, so that we could continue to use our bench microscope, but with more a much more stable assembly.

       After much CAD iteration, and a few prototypes, this was our final flow cell mount.  With good access for the objective and condenser, and a good rigid mount, we are ready to build the rest of the microscope.

        After a quick 3 hour test deployment, the system was launched by MBARI for a two week deployment in the Monterey Bay, where it was able to run with no external interference for about two weeks.  A few of my favorite photos are show below, but a <a href="http://50.247.84.90/microscope/pics/pictures"> larger collection of photos is visible here.</a>
