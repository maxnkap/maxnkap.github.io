            <span class="aboutheading">Project Background:</span> For beleaguered students and tired professionals, coffee has always been a major part of staying awake and productive. However, it has been necessary to choose between less than perfect options to get the caffeine kick so many of us crave.
            <ul>
                <li>The seemingly omnipresent pot of drip coffee in every workplace: by mid- morning it is weak, stewed, and unpleasant to drink</li>
                <li>One-cup coffee machines like the Keurig have recently replaced drip coffee in many home and office kitchens. These machines are extremely convenient, and they produce a consistent, but mediocre, cup of coffee despite the premium price.</li>
                <li>Trips to the local coffee shop are unreasonably expensive, with a simple cup of brewed coffee often costing over $2.00, along with the lost income from leaving work to go the coffee shop.</li>
                <li>Employees can make their own coffee during breaks, and it can be excellent, but a good cup of coffee is slow and in many modern workplaces, a ten-minute break to make coffee is tough to justify to the boss.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter the Automatic French press pot. French press coffee has long been considered one of the best, if slowest ways to make coffee. With a long brew time, where the ground beans and hot water are in a suspension, it is a great way to make a cup of coffee. However, it takes roughly 15 minutes to make a cup of coffee in this way, preventing students or professors from making a cup between classes, and busy employees from making a cup at work. Alfred contains a small computer connected to the Internet over Wi-Fi, wired to the hardware you need to make a great cup of coffee. With a simple message sent over the Internet, you can request between one cup and a full pot full of coffee, which is brewed for you automatically.
            <ul>
                <li>Fully automated system allows you to keep working, relax, or even sleep in while your coffee is being prepared.
                    <li>Internet connected making it possible to have a fresh brewed cup of coffee waiting wherever you are, whenever you want.</li>
                    <li>Quality components such as a burr grinder prepare coffee without compromise.</li>
                    <li>Cost-effective system freshly grinds whole bean coffee, which costs usually around 25-50 cents per cup to the consumer, and can hold around one half pound of beans and a gallon of water for brewing, to maximize time between refills.</li>
                    <li>Control computer regulates the temperature of the water used for brewing coffee with a digital thermometer</li>
            </ul>

                Before we can control our coffee system, we must first disassemble the electronics we plan to control, and wire them up with longer pigtail leads. Here we use speaker cables.
