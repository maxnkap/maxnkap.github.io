        <p>
            In highschool, I was on the Gunn Robotics Team, where we used 3D CAD and machine tools to design and build 100lb sports-playing robots. One of the tools we used to make these robots was a Hurco KM3 CNC mill (lovingly named Smurfette after the powder blue paint job) mostly used to manufacture gearboxes for the custom drivtrains. The summer after my freshman year of college I heard that the team was considering scrapping Smurfette, as it was beginning to be more trouble to use than it was worth, with an aging computer system. After speaking with the school and the team, we came to an agreement where they would give me the machine, as long as I would pay to have it moved.

                The CNC Mill when I received it had a traditional control system, using two fading 8 inch CRT monitors, making it almost impossible to use in any reasonable (safe) lighting conditions. In addition, only drip-fed GCode, or manually remade code on the internal computer was possible.

        <p>While at my summer internship position that summer, I learned about a free Linux based CNC control software <a href="http://www.linuxcnc.org/">LinuxCNC</a> and I decided to give it a try. A benefit of LinuxCNC is that there was a broad range of hardware available for interfacing to machines, and since the Hurco still had fully functional servo drivers, I was able to choose a system that only needed to be able to interface with the +/- 10V directional signal and a PWM speed signal, plus an encoder return. This lead me to go to <a href="http://www.mesanet.com/index.html">Mesa Electronics</a> where I was able to purchase a 7i43 Anything I/O computer interface card and a 7i33 servo interface card. A fully functional CNC mill would be mine for &lt $500.
            <br>

            <br> One of the limitations of the Mesa cards was that they required a parallel port and a real-time kernel in order to have fully real-time communication between the machine and the servo driver boards. I was able to find a cheap desktop tower motherboard with a parallel port, and built my first computer in order to have a system that met all the LinuxCNC requirements. Because I was using a new interface board, much of the wiring inside the machine had to go, so that I could send speed and direction signals to the servo driver boards. I was fortunate to have a fully manual with wiring diagrams and I spent many late nights poring over these diagrams figuring out where in the distribution board each signal was supposed to go, with at least one major mistake where the encoder direction and motor direction were reversed, leading to a runaway axis and (fortunately my only broken hardware while rebuilding) a broken bearing nut which was replaceable after calling around the Bay Area bearing companies.
            <br>

            <br>Unfortunately I was so carried away by upgrading Smurfette that I neglected to take many pictures during the upgrade process.

                First, it was necessary to disassemble the machine a little to have good access to the hardware and make sure all the motor drivers were working as expected. Took the chance to tension belts properly.

                From here, it was time to remove the old computer. While the nostalgia was nice, when I turned the machine on I couldn't actually see what was on the screens they were so dim.

                Finally, we can mount the new computer into the new home inside Smurfette. Bolts in to where the old computer was, but now I can see the screeen, use modern CAD/CAM software,and have 500GB of internal storage and a network connection!

                Smurfette fully upgraded with a dedicated linux box inside the machine, which is connected by wifi to Dropbox, a easy storage solution for getting GCode to the computer. It currently uses a high resolution 20 inch screen with a wireless keyboard and mouse, and is as self-contained and compact as a 3,000 pound mill could be.
