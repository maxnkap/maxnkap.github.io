            <span class="aboutheading">Project Background:</span> At Elon University, I worked with Dr. Scott Wolter of Duke University to help show that it was valid to use 100 micro electrodes to quickly and correctly monitor a redux couple reaction. Traditional techniques require use of a single electrode, and can take several minutes to gather data. In contrast, the instrument we were exploring the use of would collect the same data in ~2 seconds. We hoped to show that the specific instrument we were using, <a href="http://www.scribner.com/fuel-cell-and-electrochemical-hardware/general-electrochemistry-products/150-multichannel-microelectrode-analyzer">the Scribner Associates MMA900</a> could be used to take these high speed measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to show the validity of this instrument, we performed a series of experiments using the instrument for both traditional and Multichannel Multielectrode Analyzer measurements and verify we were getting similar results, and that the results we measured were similar to literature results for the standard redux couples we were measuring.
        </p>

        <p>
            In particular we hoped to show that we could successfully find the formal potential. Redox couples are differentiated by their formal potentials, so by verifying we found literature values for the formal potential, we could verify performance of the system.

            Some electrochemistry background, with thanks to Dr. Karl Sienerth of Elon University. We characterized this instrument with a standard reversible reduction/oxidation (redox) couple, ferro-/ferricyanide \(Fe(CN)^{4-/3-} _6\) used in these trials produces a formal potential of the Fe(CN)64-/3- reaction: $$Fe(CN)_6 ^{4-} \leftrightarrow Fe(CN)_6 ^{3-} + e$$
        </p>
        <p>
            The formal potential E0’ term may be seen in the Nernst Equation: $$E = E^{0'} - \frac{RT}{nF}ln\frac{C_0}{C_R} (1)$$ With E as the polarization voltage,F as the Faraday constant (96,485 C / mol), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K), T is the temperature (K), CO is the concentration of oxidized species in solution, and CR is the concentration of reduced species in solution.

                Initial work focused on assessing system function and a general assessment of electrode array. Initial measurements revealed an apparent series resistance inconsistency for half of the electrodes. As shown, there appeared to be one distinct grouping of similar currents measured from the odd numbered electrodes, and less consistent grouping of much higher currents located from the even numbered electrodes.

                When the physical structure of the electrodes is considered, it is evident that the even numbered electrodes have ~4x as much gold paste bridging the distance between the electrode surface located in solution, and the metal lines carrying connection to the MMA. Because the even numbered electrodes consistently showed a higher current for some given applied potential compared to the odd numbered electrodes, it is not unreasonable to assume some systemic resistance from the different current paths.

                Once we have dealt with the difficulties of the experimental setup, we were ready to verify the performance of the MMA system in "traditional" cyclic voltammetry to show that there were no additional systematic issues with the MMA.The reversible oxidation-reduction behavior was evident with the peak current in both forward and reverse reactions approximately the same at \( 2x10^{-6} \frac{A}{cm^2}\). A representative CV plot is shown, showing determination of the E0’ revealing a value of ~0.21v by locating the midpoint between the maximum and minimum currents, and in good agreement with reported literature values. (Data plotted in Mathematica due to the ~40,000 data points in the original instrument output file.)

            <p>We were able to verify that the MMA system was outputting consistent results on each electrode in use, and there were no systematic effects causing inaccurate performance, we were ready to perform potentiostatic tests, where this machine really shines. In potentiostatic tests, instead of applying a voltage range step by step with a single electrode, we apply the same range of voltages simultaneously, applying each cyclic voltammetry step to one each of an array of electrodes. Potentiostatic measurements were of focus in this investigation due to more rapid data collection, with the current measured from each electrode concurrently after less than 2s in the case of our measurements.

                    Potentials were applied for 10s at step intervals from 0.100V to 0.525V in 0.0125V increments, generating data that fit to a power regression and similar to the normal pulsed voltammetry results. The current was calculated from a best-fit power regression at 1s after the potential was initially applied.</p>

                    Potentiostatic voltammetry showed excellent agreement with the cyclic voltammetry plots in the voltage range close to the formal potential. The stable current beyond E0’ is most probably because the potentiostatic technique starts with fresh, non-oxidized solution inside the small hemispherical volume around the electrode for the entire range of potentials. The small hemispherical volume around the electrodes in the cyclic voltammetry technique quickly becomes oxidized. We can see this occurring at the peak current after which there exists a relatively slow diffusional process of refreshing ferrocyanide supply to the electrode, causing the expected mass transfer tail in cyclic voltammetry.
