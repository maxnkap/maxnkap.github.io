    		Our design problem was to create a solar radiation tracking device. The primary goal of this device was to keep a solar panel perpendicular to the solar radiation with 95% efficiency throughout the day.  We were able to build a sun tracking solar panel, untethered from an electrical grid, that charged the battery faster than it was run down.

    From here, we were ready to start building the control code.  Fortunately we only needed a very simple loop (where we compared two photoresistors and rotated towards the one reporting a brighter light), and a friendly Arduino board.

        We wrote <a href="https://github.com/efinkg/TeamSunflower">some simple code </a> and discovered we needed to redesign a few things, in order to get the solar panel to work consistently.  We also had to reconsider our motor choices.  We had anticipated a higher voltage driving the motors we had originally chosen, but had to get a higher gear ratio motor to be able to rotate the panel.  <a href="./sunflowervid0.html">  Ultimately we were able to get the motors consistently driving the panel (a short video)</a>  and we had <a href="./sunflowerfinal.html">a final hardware design. (3d view of this CAD)</a>

        From here it was just a problem of cleaning up the wiring, and some final testing to make sure everything was still working, before tweaking the code for better performance.  <a href="./sunflowervid1.html"> Once we had a smoothly working mechanical system (another short video)</a>, we were able to test the thresholds on the photoresistors and we were ready to decorate!
